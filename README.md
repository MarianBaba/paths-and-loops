# Paths & Loops 🤖

Welcome to this curated DSA repository, designed not only to showcase classical Data Structures and Algorithms but also to demonstrate a QA/Automation/SDET approach to validating, testing, and benchmarking them.

Whether you’re preparing for coding interviews, learning algorithms, or demonstrating SDET skills, this repository combines robust algorithm implementations, data structures, and automated testing best practices in TypeScript.

## 🧪 QA / SDET Twist

• Automated Unit Tests: Each algorithm and data structure comes with extensive test coverage.
• Edge Case Handling: Empty inputs, large datasets, and boundary cases are tested.
• Benchmarking & Validation: Utilities for measuring algorithm performance and validating correctness.
• Test Case Generators: Randomized input generators for stress testing algorithms.
• CI/CD Integration Ready: Designed to be easily integrated into GitHub Actions or any CI/CD pipeline.

The goal is to merge classic DSA knowledge with modern QA practices, showcasing not only how algorithms work but also how to validate, automate, and benchmark them.
