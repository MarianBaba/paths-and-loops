## 🚀 Motivation

As a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), solving problems efficiently and understanding data structures is essential for:

-   Building scalable test frameworks
-   Optimizing CI/CD pipelines
-   Automating complex workflows
-   Designing robust test data generators
-   Analyzing and monitoring system metrics

This repo is both a **learning resource** and a **portfolio showcase** of practical algorithmic thinking applied to real-world QA and automation challenges.
